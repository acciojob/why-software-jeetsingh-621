  <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
    <p>
        My motivation to become a software developer stems from my passion for problem-solving and creativity. I am excited by the opportunity to build applications that can improve people's lives and streamline processes. The ever-evolving technology landscape challenges me to learn continuously, which I find incredibly rewarding. Moreover, collaborating with others in this field allows me to share ideas and innovate together, making it a fulfilling career choice.
